## Browser upgrade tips and resources

This guide is written for:

* City officials who rely on newer browsers to perform their jobs
* Systems administrators who are not empowered by their superiors to change the system

If your city's IT infrastructure is locked down to Internet Explorer 9 or earlier, and you would like to encourage your IT department to keep up to date on modern browsers, this guide is for you.

### Overview

Paul Irish describes [the current state of things](http://www.paulirish.com/2012/the-skinny-on-ies-update-policy/) pretty aptly:

> Microsoft is in a tough spot in that they have enterprise customers who have developed their intranet applications in an extremely poor manner and they break outside of old browsers. But we’re going to need some more pushes from them and us, the developer community, to get in a better state. **We want to develop for the web platform of now, not the platform of four years ago.**

*(Emphasis ours.)*

This means, in particular, the fellows at Code for America must wrestle with two prorities:

1. Developing web services for the platform of now, *so that it serves the expectations of the city's residents.*
2. Developing services for the web platform of four years ago, *so that it serves the expectations of the city's IT managers.*

The final result will differ between each engagement of the cities and its fellows, but a choice will have to be made when, and if, these two priorities are not aligned. In general, though, it should be reasonable to expect that as we encourage innovation and user-centered needs in city government, that we also nudge the city into adopting the appropriate technologies for those ends. 

One of these technologies is the city's standard browser deployment. Upgrading your browsers will save time and money, increase security, and make your citizens happy.

### Responses

Remember, modern browsers are:

* Free
* More secure
* Have better features

In other words, there's really no good reason not to upgrade. But in case you face some, here's how you can respond if someone in your organization provides some common reasons against upgrading your browser.

> __“We’ve developed or procured internal software that only runs on a specific version of browser.”__

* Does everyone on staff need to use that particular piece of software?  If not, why cripple everyone else’s ability to use a modern browser?
* You can have more than one browser on a computer. Users can have a modern browser by default, with a back-up browser to run older software. This is the premise behind  [Chrome for Business](http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/business/browser/admin/) with [Legacy Browser Support](http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/business/browser/lbs.html).

> __“We can’t upgrade past IE8 because we’re still running Windows XP.”__

* Other modern browsers, like Chrome and Firefox, do not require a Windows upgrade. You can use them on Windows XP, in addition to IE8.

> __“Other browsers don’t have enterprise-level support.”__

IT managers are often concerned that switching browsers will prevent them from controlling access policies site-wide, or managing upgrade paths. This is completely false.

* [Chrome has enterprise support.](http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/business/browser/)
* [Firefox has enterprise support.](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/)
* Microsoft will end support for Windows XP, and Internet Explorer 8, on April 8, 2014. This can result in [severe security risks for your organization](http://blogs.technet.com/b/security/archive/2013/08/15/the-risk-of-running-windows-xp-after-support-ends.aspx). If you are still on this browser, you should have a plan in place!

> __“We can’t support other browsers, because it will cost us additional time and money.”__

* Your support time is probably increased because more problems will occur on an older browser. Modern browsers will actually reduce calls for tech support.
* Modern browsers benefit from bug fixes, and security patches that reduce your own support burden.
* The benefits of your staff being able to perform their jobs better with modern browsers can result in other savings for your organization.
* Procuring software that works on older versions of IE is a time and cost burden to your budget. For instance, one startup estimated that supporting Internet Explorer [doubled or tripled their development time](http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/01/bootstrapped-startup-saves-over-100k-by-dropping-ie/), which resulted in ballooning the cost. This additional time is one reason why Code for America apps do not always have the luxury of supporting older browsers. Imagine, though, how much money is sunk into procuring Internet Explorer-friendly software projects because the up-front investment wasn't deemed worth it.

> __“Our staff won’t know how to use other browsers.”__

* This is not a good excuse to have when your staff is requesting other browsers.
* There will always be staff that don’t care that their browser is old, and just want things to work the same way forever. However, there are also staff that can do their jobs better when the browsers that they need are given to them. Cater to those staff that need it.

> __“We don’t need to upgrade. Everything works fine.”__

* It does not. Google, for instance, has a policy of only supporting the last two released versions of the Internet Explorer browser (currently, 10 and 11). Google Apps [dropped IE8 support on November 2012](http://googleappsupdates.blogspot.com/2012/09/supporting-modern-browsers-internet.html) and [dropped IE9 support on November 2013](http://googleappsupdates.blogspot.ca/2013/11/end-of-support-for-internet-explorer-9.html). Google's Analytics service [will stop supporting IE8 at the end of 2013](http://analytics.blogspot.com/2013/09/supporting-modern-browsing-experience.html).
* Web applications developed using current standards in web technology may not work properly in older versions of Internet Explorer, including applications developed by Code for America.

> __“We don’t have time to do it right now, but we can do it some time in the future.”__

* Installing a browser is fast and easy. The staff that needs it can do it on their own, without your help.

> __"This might not work, and I don't want to raise any noise about it."__

Actually, you might be interested in hearing from other municipalities that have successfully implemented a modern browser policy:
