# Using GitHub

[GitHub] is a source code repository and hosting service for software development projects that use the [Git revision control system][git], and is the most popular code repository site for open source projects. Because of its widespread adoption and ease of use, source code for all Code for America projects are hosted on GitHub.

If you're familiar with source code version control systems like [Subversion (SVN)](http://subversion.apache.org/) or [Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/), then you'll understand Git. If you've never used Git before, think about how Wikipedia remembers the history of a page and can show differences between each edit of a page. Git handles this for you.

If you're familiar with source code repositories like [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) or [SourceForge](http://http://sourceforge.net/), then you'll understand GitHub. It's a website that hosts source code for projects that use the Git version control system. Best of all, it's free for open source projects, and helps manage large numbers of multiple collaborators on the same projects.

## GitHub for Government

Best of all, GitHub is designed for government employees and government projects. If you have a .gov e-mail address, you can go to [GitHub for Government](http://government.github.com/) and join the private government-employee-only organization, where you can discuss experiences and best practices with other government employees.

Getting government employees on GitHub is a great idea, since it allows them to communicate and [collaborate with Code for America Fellows](https://github.com/codeforamerica/lv-trucks-map/issues/34) effectively. Even non-technical employees can participate: for the launch of [BizFriendly](http://bizfriend.ly/), Kansas City, Missouri, mayor Sly James [issued a pull request as a virtual act of ribbon-cutting](https://github.com/codeforamerica/bizfriendly-web/pull/136).
